# Proxy pattern

Purpose : to hide the desired object and provide same interface to the client
          to control accessing to the desired object
          to prevent updating the desired object or to decrease the creation cost of the object with a large initial configuration
          to add a layer of security to the original underlying object to provide controlled access based on access rights of the client

PS:
 - Proxy has same the interface as the desired object has
 - Client does not know the object is real or proxy
