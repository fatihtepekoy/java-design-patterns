# Decorator pattern

Purpose : to add more capability to the object without adding them to the class of the object by inheritance
          to attach additional responsibilities to the object dynamically on run time
          to provide an enhanced interface

PS:
 - Each decorator object wraps previous one, this is different than composition
 -
