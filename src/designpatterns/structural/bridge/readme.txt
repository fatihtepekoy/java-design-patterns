# Proxy pattern

Purpose : to decouple the interfaces from implementation and hiding the implementation details from the client programs.
          to decouple the interfaces from implementation


PS:
 - In using of the inheritance, all public and protected methods causes coupling if child class does not override them, properties as well.
 - Decreases coupling by converting is-a-relations to has-a-relations
 - Coupling coming from only interfaces not from the implementations, interfaces are not changed often.
