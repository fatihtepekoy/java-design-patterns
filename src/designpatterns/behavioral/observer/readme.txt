# Observer Pattern

Purpose : - to notify observers(subscribers) whenever there is any change on observable(publisher) object
          - to provide a way to subscribe and unsubscribe to the clients.



PS:
 - there is one-to-many relationship between objects such as if one object is modified, its dependent objects are to be notified automatically
