# Command Pattern

Purpose : - to encapsulate in an object all the data required for performing a given action (command)



PS:
 - Create a factory class fot the commands
 - A request is wrapped under an object as command and passed to invoker object.
 - is used to implement loose coupling in a request-response model.
