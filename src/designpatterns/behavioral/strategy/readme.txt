# Strategy pattern(also knows Policy Pattern)

Purpose : - to decide which algorithm implementation to be used at runtime.
          - to provide algorithm option to the client



PS:
 - define multiple algorithms and let client pass the algorithm to be used as a parameter.
 - One of the best example of strategy pattern is Collections.sort()
